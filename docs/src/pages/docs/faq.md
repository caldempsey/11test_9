**Q. What cloud providers do you support?**

_A._ Currently, we support [Lambda Labs](https://lambdalabs.com), [GCP - private beta](htts://cloud.google.com), and
   the Unweave hosted platform.

**Q. How much do you mark up the cost of the cloud provider? How do you make money?**

_A._ Zero! We don't mark up the cost of the cloud provider. The margins are too thin anyway. We make 
   money through our hosted SaaS service that will eventually include a team/pro pricing tier.
